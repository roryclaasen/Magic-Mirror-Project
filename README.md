# Magic Mirror Project
Over the summer I am going to make a magic mirror using the Pi zero. This repository is code that will do the visualization of the mirror

# My setup
### Monitor
The monitor that I am using is an old one that was lying around.
The important part is the screen size that is 1280px x 1024px

### Mirror
The mirror that I will be using will be a 2 way Acrylic mirror.
As of yet is still yet to be bought but it will most likely be bought from [Cut Plastic Sheeting](http://www.cutplasticsheeting.co.uk/mirrored-sheeting/two-way-acrylic-mirror)

### Frame
The frame has still yet to be decided... Well I can't decide right but it will probably be something from B&Q (pre finished) or a paint job done by myself.

## Peripherals
- [7 port USB Hub](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mobilizers-Switches-Notebook-Computer-Tablets/dp/B008543CKI)

	Yes this is a bit of an overkill allowing so many ports when in reality I may only need 3 or 4
- [Tontec 150Mbps USB Wifi Dongle Adapter for Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tontec-150Mbps-Adapter-Raspberry-Windows/dp/B010AKMF3Y/)

- Mouse and keyboard

	These will be plugged in when I need to. They are not essential when the mirror is working
